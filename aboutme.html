      <p>During my free time I love to catch up on my sleep. When I am not sleeping I enjoy listening to music on my record player. Other times, my friends and I love to play old school video games. Often, we play Nintendo games on our old school systems. Lastly, I enjoy traveling and having a great time with great company. Spending time with my friends in the city Providence, Rhode Island is one of my favorites.
